                    <p>Want to challenge yourself on the water with only the wind and your muscles to move you? The
                        Georgian Bay Walkabout is a
                        ~300 nautical mile circumnavigation of the bay. Your vessel is your choice as long as it doesn't
                        have an engine. Besides
                        abiding by Coast Guard safety and equipment regulations, the only other rule is that you have to
                        get yourself and your
                        crew around the course. Checkpoints to be determined.
                        This event is for those who are very experienced in their vessel of choice. You will be
                        responsible for your own
                        logistics and safety. The organizers will not offer logistical support.

                Boats may range from kayaks that are launched by hand from a dock or shoreline, to larger boats that may
                need a
                transient dock space. There will be virtual and physical checkpoints along the way that participants
                must visit. The
                physical checkpoints will have a lockbox with combination lock which will contain a logbook for
                participants to sign.
                The location will also be an opportunity for participants to obtain rest, food and water. The event will
                start on
                Saturday September 14th and end on September 22.

                    <p>The event is designed to emulate the Race to Alaska in Port Townsend, Washington. In it, boats
                        are
                        not allowed to have
                        engines on board; human or wind power only. A course is set, and besides some safety rules,
                        that's about it. In this
                        case, the full route will be a circumnavigation of Georgian Bay. A shorter course will be
                        offered which will travel up
                        the east side of Georgian Bay.

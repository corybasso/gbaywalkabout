                <p>Want to challenge yourself on the water with only the wind and your muscles to move you? The
                    Georgian Bay Walkabout is a
                    ~300 nautical mile circumnavigation of the bay. Your vessel is your choice as long as it doesn't
                    have an engine. Besides
                    abiding by Coast Guard safety and equipment regulations, the only other rule is that you have to
                    get yourself and your
                    crew around the course. Checkpoints to be determined.
                    This event is for those who are very experienced in their vessel of choice. You will be
                    responsible for your own
                    logistics and safety. The organizers will not offer logistical support.

                    Boats may range from kayaks that are launched by hand from a dock or shoreline, to larger boats that may
                    need a
                    transient dock space. There will be virtual and physical checkpoints along the way that participants
                    must visit. The
                    physical checkpoints will have a lockbox with combination lock which will contain a logbook for
                    participants to sign.
                    The location will also be an opportunity for participants to obtain rest, food and water. The event will
                    start on
                    Saturday September 14th and end on September 22.</p>

                <p>The event is designed to emulate the Race to Alaska in Port Townsend, Washington. In it, boats
                    are
                    not allowed to have
                    engines on board; human or wind power only. A course is set, and besides some safety rules,
                    that's about it. In this
                    case, the full route will be a circumnavigation of Georgian Bay. A shorter course will be
                    offered which will travel up
                    the east side of Georgian Bay.
